Abstract: A central problem with distributed ledger technologies involves the latency that must be incurred in processing and verifying transactions to be accepted as permanent records in the ledger. In many applications, high latency is simply not a tolerable aspect of the governance of the ledger. To help reduce latency, we offer a distributed ledger architecture, Tango, that mimics the Iota-tangle design as articulated by Popov in his seminal paper. A main idea is the introduction of a semi-synchronous transaction entry protocol layer. We model periodic pulsed injections into the evaluation layer from the entry layer.

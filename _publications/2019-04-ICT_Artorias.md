**Abstract**: Products that are connected and controlled remotely via the Internet are becoming more prevalent, and as a result, homes and businesses have ever increasing attack surfaces on their networks. To raise the standard of security, companies need more ways to automate testing of the most commonly found issues with IoT devices against their products. The creation of an automated security testing framework, such as Artorias, allows companies to automate the process of finding easy to identify problems, saving time for more advanced and manual processes of security and functional testing on a product. To show the frameworkâ€™s stability and reliability, things such as proper coding standards should be adhered to, proper management of the project should be present, and unit-tests or code coverage of the framework should be created and maintained. This ongoing project bridges together the principles of security and proper planning and development of a larger programming effort. In this paper, we introduce the IoT Security Testing Framework Artorias, and present an extensible framework that interested research community members can extend for more coverage on privacy and security issues of IoT devices. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4cd62h2xdp3m5ig/PID5800975.pdf?dl=0"><img src="../files/pdflogo.jpg" width="30"></a> <a href="../files/bibtexfiles/2019-04-ICT_Artorias.bib"><img src="../files/bibtexIcon.jpg" width="30"></a>

**Abstract**: Internet of Things devices have spread to near ubiquity this decade. All around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this paper is to put its security standards to test. By attempting to exploit its vulnerabilities we can see how secure this standard really is. In this paper, we present steps for analyzing the security of BLE devices using open-source hardware and software. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkxt0zhakwf1pl4/PID5694119.pdf?dl=0"><img src="../files/pdflogo.jpg" width="30"></a> <a href="../files/bibtexfiles/2019-01-ICEIC_Bluetooth.bib"><img src="../files/bibtexIcon.jpg" width="30"></a>

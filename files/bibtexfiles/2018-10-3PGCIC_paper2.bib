abstract="Distributed ledger technologies have a central problem that involves the latency. When transactions are to be accepted in the ledger, latency is incurred due to transaction processing and verification. For efficient systems, high latency should be avoided for the governance of the ledger. To help reduce latency, we offer a distributed ledger architecture, Tango, that mimics the Iota-tangle design as articulated by PopovÂ [1] in his seminal paper. We introduce a semi-synchronous transaction entry protocol layer to avoid asynchronism in the system since an asynchronous system has a high latency. We further model periodic pulsed injections into the evaluation layer from the entry layer to regulate the performance of the system.",

NCS 490: Network Forensics
---
In this course we learn to recognize hackers’ tracks and uncover network-based evidence.
We investigate methods to carve suspicious email attachments from packet captures. 
Use flow records to track an intruder as he pivots through the network. 
Analyze a real-world wireless encryption-cracking attack (and then crack the key yourself). 
Reconstruct a suspects' web surfing history–and cached web pages, too–from a web proxy. 
Uncover DNS-tunneled traffic. Dissect the Operation Aurora exploit, caught on the wire.

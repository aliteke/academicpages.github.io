NCS 590: Internet of Things Security
======
This was a Special Topic course, covers the emerging topic of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and it's (in)security. 
In the first half of the semester, we cover the chapters from the required textbook such as: 
IoT uses, IoT in the Enterprise, IoT Vulnerabilities, Attacks and Countermeasures, etc. 
Since it is a Masters level course, in the remaining time we will read, review and present academic papers in the class. 
We will also have a final (group) project which will investigate a specific IoT device's security and present a report.
